## This is so inconvenient WTF?
I agree.  I started this project as a collection of JavaScript functions that I could use instead of bookmarks.  My idea is to get a little practice at JavaScript coding while I am browsing.  I think it will be interesting to see whether I write and learn more and more JavaScript.  It is total overhead.
